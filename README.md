Hellcat
=======
Hellcat is a high performance database experiment project to see how fast of a database I can write in C and C++.

My other high performance experiment project [Haywire](https://github.com/kellabyte/Haywire) is used in Hellcat to accept get and put requests over HTTP. 

## Goals

- Compete with Redis and Memcached in performance.
- Add Redis and Memcached client protocol compatibility support.
- Ability to run with in-memory only mode or ACID mode with persistence and serializable isolation.
- SIMD hardware accelerated indexes for search queries.
- Replication.

## Contributors
I would love to work with others on this project to see what we can accomplish and to improve my C and C++ skills. If you're interested let me know!
